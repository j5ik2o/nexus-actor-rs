# Go Example with Proto.Actor Auto Response

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates the use of the Auto Response feature in the Proto.Actor framework. It illustrates how an actor can automatically generate a response to a message.

## Description
In this example, we define `myAutoResponder` and `myAutoResponse` types to use the Auto Response feature of Proto.Actor. This feature allows an actor to automatically create a response message upon receiving a specific type of message. This is particularly useful for acknowledging message receipt in systems like the ClusterPubSub feature.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go installed in your environment

You can install Proto.Actor using the following command:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `myAutoResponder` struct implements the `GetAutoResponse` method which is essential for the Auto Response mechanism.
- The `main` function initializes an actor system, creates an actor, and sends a message to it. The response is then printed to the console.

This example provides a basic understanding of how to implement and use the Auto Response feature in the Proto.Actor framework in Go.
