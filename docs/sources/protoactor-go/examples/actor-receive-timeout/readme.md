# Go Example: Receive Timeout with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example showcases the use of receive timeout in the Proto.Actor framework. It demonstrates how to handle timeouts and messages that do not influence the receive timeout.

## Description
The program sets up an actor that uses `SetReceiveTimeout` to trigger actions if no messages are received within a specified duration. It also introduces a custom message type, `NoInfluence`, that does not reset the receive timeout. This example is useful for understanding timeout handling in actor-based systems.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The actor sets a receive timeout and logs a message each time the timeout is triggered.
- The `NoInfluence` message type is designed to be processed without resetting the timeout.
- The example illustrates how to cancel the receive timeout with a specific message.
- This example is ideal for developers looking to implement timeout mechanisms in their actor-based applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides insight into managing receive timeouts and non-influential messages in a Go application with the Proto.Actor framework.
