# Go Example: Actor Supervision with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example showcases actor supervision in the Proto.Actor framework. It demonstrates how to handle failures and supervise child actors within a parent actor.

## Description
The program defines two actor types: `parentActor` and `childActor`. The `parentActor` spawns a `childActor` and sends a message to it. The `childActor` simulates a failure upon receiving the message, triggering the supervision strategy defined in the parent actor. This example is crucial for understanding error handling and supervision in actor-based systems.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `parentActor` is responsible for creating and supervising the `childActor`.
- The `childActor` deliberately causes a panic to demonstrate the supervision mechanism.
- The supervision strategy is defined using `actor.NewOneForOneStrategy`.
- This example is particularly useful for developers looking to implement robust error handling and actor supervision in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a detailed insight into actor supervision and error handling in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
