# Go Example: Custom Mailbox Logging with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates how to implement custom mailbox logging in the Proto.Actor framework. It shows how to track mailbox events such as message posting, receiving, and when the mailbox becomes empty.

## Description
The program sets up an actor system with a custom mailbox logger, `mailboxLogger`. This logger logs different events related to the actor's mailbox, such as when a message is posted or received, and when the mailbox is empty. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the behavior of actors in more complex systems.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `mailboxLogger` struct implements methods to log different mailbox events.
- Custom mailbox logging provides insights into the message processing lifecycle of an actor.
- The example illustrates an effective way to monitor and debug actor behavior in the Proto.Actor framework.
- This example is beneficial for developers looking to implement advanced monitoring and logging mechanisms in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example offers a clear demonstration of custom mailbox logging in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
