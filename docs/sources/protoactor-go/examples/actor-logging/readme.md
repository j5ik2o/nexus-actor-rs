# Go Example: Advanced Logging with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates various logging mechanisms within the Proto.Actor framework. It shows how to implement different types of logging, including JSON, console, colored console, and Zap adapter logging.

## Description
The program creates a simple actor system and uses different logging methods to log a `hello` message. This example is useful for understanding how to implement and customize logging in applications using the Proto.Actor framework, offering insights into structured logging and its benefits.

## Setup
To run this example, make sure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go
- Necessary logging libraries

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
go get -u github.com/lmittmann/tint
go get -u go.uber.org/zap
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The example includes different logging functions: `jsonLogging`, `consoleLogging`, `coloredConsoleLogging`, and `zapAdapterLogging`.
- The `helloActor` struct handles a `hello` message and logs it using the specified logging method.
- This example is ideal for developers looking to implement advanced logging techniques in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a comprehensive demonstration of various logging methods in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
