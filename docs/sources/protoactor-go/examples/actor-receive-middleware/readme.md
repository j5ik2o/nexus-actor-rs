# Go Example: Middleware Usage with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates the use of middleware in the Proto.Actor framework. It illustrates how to enhance actor functionality with additional layers of processing.

## Description
The example sets up a basic actor system where the `receive` function handles a `hello` message. Middleware, specifically the logger middleware, is added to the actor properties to log incoming messages. This example is an excellent demonstration of using middleware to augment actor behavior in Proto.Actor.

## Setup
To run this example, make sure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `receive` function acts as the message handler for the actor.
- Middleware is added to the actor properties using `actor.WithReceiverMiddleware`.
- The logger middleware logs each message received by the actor.
- This example is ideal for those who want to understand how to implement and use middleware in actor-based systems using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a clear demonstration of incorporating middleware into an actor in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
