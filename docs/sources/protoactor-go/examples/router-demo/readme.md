# Go Example: Routing Strategies with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example explores various routing strategies in the Proto.Actor framework, including Round Robin, Random, ConsistentHash, and BroadcastPool routing.

## Description
The program sets up an actor system and demonstrates four different routing strategies: Round Robin, Random, ConsistentHash, and BroadcastPool. Each strategy is used to distribute messages among a pool of actors. The `myMessage` struct, which includes a custom hash function, is used to demonstrate message routing behavior.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The example illustrates how messages are processed differently under each routing strategy.
- Round Robin distributes messages evenly among actors, Random chooses actors randomly, ConsistentHash routes based on message hash, and BroadcastPool sends messages to all actors in the pool.
- Understanding these routing strategies is crucial for building scalable and efficient actor-based systems.
- This example is beneficial for developers looking to implement advanced message routing mechanisms in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a comprehensive overview of implementing various routing strategies in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
