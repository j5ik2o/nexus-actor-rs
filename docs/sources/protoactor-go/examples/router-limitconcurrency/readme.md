# Go Example: Concurrency Control with Routers in Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example highlights concurrency control using routers in the Proto.Actor framework. It illustrates how to limit the concurrency level when processing messages in an actor system.

## Description
The program creates an actor system with a Round Robin router to distribute work items among a pool of actors. The maximum concurrency level is set to `maxConcurrency`. Each actor processes `workItem` messages, ensuring that the concurrency level does not exceed the defined limit. This example is key for understanding concurrency control in actor-based systems.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The example uses a Round Robin router to distribute messages evenly among actors.
- `doWork` is the function each actor uses to process messages, respecting the `maxConcurrency` limit.
- This approach is beneficial for managing workload and preventing overloading actors.
- The example is ideal for developers looking to implement controlled concurrency in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides an insightful demonstration of managing concurrency with routers in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
