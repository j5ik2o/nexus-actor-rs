# Go Example: Behavior Switching in Actors with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates behavior switching in actors using the Proto.Actor framework. It shows how an actor can change its behavior dynamically in response to messages.

## Description
The program defines a `SetBehaviorActor` with two behaviors: `One` and `Other`. Initially, the actor responds to a `Hello` message with the `One` behavior. Upon receiving a `Hello` message, it switches to the `Other` behavior for subsequent messages. This example illustrates the dynamic behavior capabilities of actors in Proto.Actor, allowing them to adapt their responses based on their state or received messages.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```


# Switchable Behaviors
Actors have the power to switch their behaviors at any point in time. This is usually referred as *becoming something*,
as in *the actor becomes busy* or *the actor becomes connected*.

This is accomplished by replacing the method that handles messages inside the actor using `SetBehavior`
or `PushBehavior`.
These methods accept a delegate that will handle the next messages until you decide to replace it again.

This is a powerful concept that is behind other features like Finite State Machines.

> **Note:**<br /> When you change the actor behavior, the new behaviour will take effect for all subsequent messages
> until the behaviour is changed again. The current message will continue processing with the existing behaviour.
> You can use Stashing to reprocess the current message with the new behavior.

## API

The API to change behaviors is available to the actor instance is very simple:

* `Become` - Replaces the message handler with the specified delegate;
* `BecomeStacked` - Adds the specified message handler to the top of the behavior stack, while maintaining the previous
  ones;
* `UnbecomeStacked` - Reverts to the previous message handler from the stack (only works with PushBehavior);


## Additional Notes
- The `SetBehaviorActor` uses the `Behavior` type to switch between `One` and `Other`.
- The actor starts with the `One` behavior and switches to `Other` after processing the first `Hello` message.
- This technique is useful for creating flexible and stateful actors that can change their behavior during runtime.
- The example is beneficial for developers looking to implement dynamic actor behaviors in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a comprehensive demonstration of behavior switching in actors within a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
