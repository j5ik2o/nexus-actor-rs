# Go Example: Message Scheduling with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example showcases message scheduling in the Proto.Actor framework. It demonstrates various ways to schedule and cancel message delivery to actors.

## Description
The program sets up an actor system and uses the scheduler to send and request messages at specified intervals. It also demonstrates the cancellation of scheduled messages. The example uses an array of `HelloMessages` in different languages to illustrate message scheduling and processing.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The example uses the `scheduler` package for sending and requesting messages at regular intervals.
- The ability to cancel scheduled messages is also demonstrated, which is useful for dynamic scheduling scenarios.
- This example is ideal for developers looking to implement time-based message scheduling in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a comprehensive demonstration of using a message scheduler in a Go application with the Proto.Actor framework.
