# Go Example: Message Batching with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates the concept of message batching in the Proto.Actor framework. It shows how to group multiple messages into a single batch and process them individually.

## Description
The program creates an actor system and defines a `myMessageBatch` struct, which groups multiple messages together. These messages are then sent as a single batch to the actor but processed as individual messages. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios like cluster PubSub, where batching can improve performance and efficiency.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The example demonstrates how to create and send a batch of messages using the `myMessageBatch` struct.
- The actor processes each message in the batch individually, showcasing effective message batching.
- This approach is beneficial for scenarios requiring efficient message processing and delivery.
- The example is ideal for developers looking to implement message batching in their Go applications using Proto.Actor.

This example provides a clear understanding of message batching in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
