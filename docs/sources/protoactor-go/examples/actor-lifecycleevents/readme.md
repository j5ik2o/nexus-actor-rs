# Go Example: Actor Lifecycle Events with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates handling actor lifecycle events in the Proto.Actor framework. It showcases the various stages in an actor's life, from initialization to shutdown.

## Description
The program creates an actor system and demonstrates the lifecycle events of an actor, including `Started`, `Stopping`, `Stopped`, and `Restarting`. It also sends a `hello` message to the actor to illustrate interaction during its active state. This example is valuable for understanding the lifecycle management of actors in actor-based systems.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure you have:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `helloActor` struct handles different lifecycle events and logs corresponding messages.
- The `main` function initializes an actor system, spawns a `helloActor`, sends it a message, and then stops it to demonstrate the lifecycle events.
- This example is a practical demonstration for those interested in the lifecycle management of actors in the Proto.Actor framework.

The example provides a clear view of the lifecycle events of an actor in a Go application using the Proto.Actor framework.
