# Go Example: Handling Invalid PIDs with Deadletter in Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This Go example demonstrates handling invalid PIDs (Process Identifiers) using the deadletter mechanism in the Proto.Actor framework. It showcases how messages sent to invalid PIDs are managed by the deadletter handler.

## Description
The example sets up a scenario where messages are sent to an invalid PID. This triggers the deadletter mechanism, which is a way to handle messages that cannot be delivered to their intended recipients. The program includes options to adjust the rate of message sending, the throttle of deadletter logs, and the duration of the message-sending loop.

## Setup
To run this example, ensure the following are installed:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

Install Proto.Actor with the following command:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```
You can also pass optional flags like `--rate`, `--throttle`, and `--duration` to adjust the behavior of the example.

## Additional Notes
- The `main` function initializes an actor system with a custom configuration for deadletter handling.
- The program sends messages to a deliberately invalid PID to demonstrate how the deadletter mechanism works in Proto.Actor.
- The example is useful for understanding the deadletter process in actor-based systems, especially for error handling and debugging.

This example provides insight into managing undeliverable messages in the Proto.Actor framework using Go.
