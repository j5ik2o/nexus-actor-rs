# BaseActor Cleanup Status (2025-09-26)

- Code removal completed (context_base.rs, context_ext.rs, migration.rs, adapters.rs, actor_behavior_base.rs, actor_handle_base.rs)
- `ActorSpawnerExt` introduced as replacement for old BaseSpawner API
- Legacy examples moved to `core/examples/legacy/`
- Remaining task: update all docs to reference Actor-only APIs
