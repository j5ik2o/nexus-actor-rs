# Nexus Actor RS - Project Status

Last Updated: 2025/05/28

## Overview

This document consolidates all project planning, issues, and progress tracking into a single source of truth.

## Current Status: Circular Dependency Resolution ✅

### Completed Work
The circular dependency between core and context modules has been successfully resolved using a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1-4 Completed**
   - Extracted independent message types to `core_types` module
   - Created base traits (BaseActor, BaseContext) without circular dependencies
   - Implemented adapter layer for backward compatibility
   - Migrated internal actors (ActorBehaviorBase, ActorHandleBase)
   - Added dual support for both Actor and BaseActor types

2. **Key Achievements**
   - ✅ All 85+ tests passing
   - ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing API
   - ✅ Complete backward compatibility
   - ✅ New cleaner BaseActor trait for new development
   - ✅ Existing code continues to work unchanged

### Architecture Improvement
```
Before: actor ←→ context (circular dependency)
After:  core_types → BaseActor → BaseContext → Adapters → Traditional Actor/Context
```

## High Priority Issues

### 1. ~~Circular Dependencies~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- Successfully resolved through the creation of independent base traits and adapter layer

### 2. Test Code Organization (In Progress)
**Current Issues:**
- Test code mixed with implementation (`*_test.rs` files)
- Inconsistent test file placement
- Unit and integration tests not clearly separated

**Impact:**
- Reduced test maintainability
- Difficult to navigate test suite
- Unclear test coverage

**Next Steps:**
- Move tests to `tests/` directory structure
- Separate unit tests from integration tests
- Establish clear test organization conventions

### 3. Module Structure Complexity
**Current Issues:**
- Complex nested directory structure in `actor/`
- Unclear module boundaries
- Difficult navigation for new developers

**Planned Solution:**
- Flatten module structure where appropriate
- Create clear module boundaries
- Improve documentation of module responsibilities

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 5: Complete Migration (Future)
1. Deprecate old Actor trait (with migration warnings)
2. Update all examples to use BaseActor
3. Complete documentation update
4. Performance optimization
5. Remove adapter layer (major version)

### Long-term Goals
1. **Simplify Module Structure**
   - Reduce nesting levels
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Better discoverability

2. **Improve Developer Experience**
   - Better documentation
   - More examples
   - Clear migration guides

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduce dynamic dispatch where possible
   - Optimize message passing
   - Improve actor spawn performance

## Development Guidelines

### For New Code
- Use `BaseActor` trait for all new actors
- Follow the examples in `examples/actor-base-traits/`
- Use `BaseSpawnerExt` for convenient actor spawning

### For Existing Code
- No immediate changes required
- Migrate to BaseActor when convenient
- Use migration helpers for gradual transition

## Technical Debt Items

1. **Remove unused imports** - Multiple warnings in various modules
2. **Clean up test modules** - Remove unused test utilities
3. **Update documentation** - Reflect new BaseActor approach
4. **Optimize Props creation** - Reduce overhead in migration layer
